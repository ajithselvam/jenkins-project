Simple Jenkins Project: "Message Printer"
Goal: Create a Jenkins job that runs a shell script to print "Jenkins is awesome!" and verifies the output.

What You’ll Need:
Jenkins installed (e.g., on http://localhost:8080 if local).
A basic text editor to create a script.

Optional: A Git repository if you want to pull the script from there.

Steps:
Create a Simple Shell Script:
Open a text editor and create a file called message.sh.
Add this content:


#!/bin/bash
echo "Jenkins is awesome!"

Save it somewhere Jenkins can access (e.g., your local filesystem like /home/user/jenkins-projects/message.sh).
Make it executable by running this in your terminal:

chmod +x message.sh


Optional: Use Git:
If you want to practice with Git, create a repository (e.g., on GitHub), add message.sh, and push it. For simplicity here, I’ll assume you’re using a local file, but I can adjust if you prefer Git.


Set Up the Jenkins Job:
Open your Jenkins dashboard (e.g., http://localhost:8080).
Click New Item on the left sidebar.
Enter a name like "SimpleMessagePrinter".
Select Freestyle project and click OK.


Configure the Job:
Scroll down to the Build section.
Click Add build step and select Execute shell.
In the command box, type:



/path/to/your/message.sh  # Replace with the actual path, e.g., /home/user/jenkins-projects/message.sh
if [ "$(/path/to/your/message.sh)" == "Jenkins is awesome!" ]; then
    echo "Success: Message printed correctly!"
else
    echo "Error: Message didn’t match!" && exit 1
fi


This runs the script and checks if the output is correct. Replace /path/to/your/message.sh with wherever you saved it.


Save and Test:
Click Save at the bottom.
On the project page, click Build Now.

Once the build runs, click the build number (e.g., #1) in the Build History section, then select Console Output.
You should see:


Started by user [your-username]
...
Jenkins is awesome!
Success: Message printed correctly!
Finished: SUCCESS


What This Does:
The job runs your message.sh script.
It checks the output to ensure it says "Jenkins is awesome!".
If it matches, you get a success message; if not, the build fails (handy for learning how Jenkins handles pass/fail).
